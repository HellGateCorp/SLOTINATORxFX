# Slotinator
Next generation of a JavaFX based Gambling Super Heroe Slot machine, now shipped with special Effects and an unique taste of the good old 90's. 🎰🦹🏻‍♂️👾

*notice -> run it with Java 8 (=1.8.0) into your favourite IDE. Ready working Jars are in Progress.
 
The inspiration behind this Repo was to still improve my Skills and learn more about how Animations and the graphical Effects work with JavaFX 2 and the Scenebuilder 2 from Gluon, so I dive deeper into the Rabbithole and  created an advanced version of a modern day Java based Slot Machine. You can find a lot of java slot machines here on github that are like my first version where you just set the icons once with an array of images and the Math.random class, ok fine. But how to really make it look like the Wheel is spinning, just like those from the you have to pay online casinos ?? And just how to can implement it in JavaFX, that WITH the Scenebuilder... and WITHOUT to have a look on StackOverflow.com ?? 

For me this type of Mindfuck  can only be successful if I fight my way through the process of reading carefully the Java Class Docs, to really understand it and the Math behind and implementing the needed Part from a Class into your ready working codebase from Version 1. Let me tell you the little secret that this Process isn't always as easy as you might think and only can be sucessfull when you really start to coding and debugging it. That gives ust the possibility to see how every single line of Code excatly work and which Parameters need to be adjustment.

I want say that it's defenitly not perfect, but I found a way to make it work and look pretty too, so im really happy with it. After did the work now its Time to push it to Github... Have fun with it. 🤖
