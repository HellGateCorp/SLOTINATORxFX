# Slotinator
Next generation of a JavaFX based Gambling Super Heroe Slot machine, now shipped with special Effects and an unique taste of the good old 90's. 🎰🦹🏻‍♂️👾

I created this advanced version to dive deeper into the basics of JavaFX 2 and Scenebuilder 2. The inspiration behind it was to learn more about how animations and the graphic effects work. For me this can only be successful if I fight my way through the process of reading the Java Class Docs and integrating the needed function into your always ready working codebase. Before you introduce yourself, let me tell you that this isn't always as easy as you might think. Actually start coding and debugging. So that you can also see what exactly is happening at that moment at your convenience.

I've seen a lot of java slot machines here on github that were like my first version where you just set the icons once with an array of images and the Math.random class, ok fine. But how to really make it look like the wheel is spinning like these from the real cash-in/cash-out online casinos and how to implement it in JavaFX and WITH the Scenebuilder... WITHOUT looking on StackOverflow? ? :)

Now I want to say that it's not perfect but I found a way to make it work and look pretty too. So I did the work and pushed it to Github now... Have fun with it. 🤖
