# Slotinator
Next generation of a JavaFX based Gambling Super Heroe Slot machine, now shipped with special Effects and an unique taste of the good old 90's. 🎰🦹🏻‍♂️👾

I made this more advanced Version to dive deeper into the fundamentals in JavaFX 2 and the Scenebuilder 2. The Inspiration behind was to learn more specific about how Annimations and the graphicals Effects work. For me that only could be successful if you fight you through the process of reading the Java Class Docs and how you have to intigrate the needed Function into your allways builded Codebase.. And let me tell you that isnt allways as easy as you may thing before you start to write and debugging the hole Progress.

I saw many Java Slot machines hhere on Github which was like my first Version, where you set the the Icons only onece with an Array of Pictures and the Math.random Class, okay fine. But how you really could make its look like the Wheel is spinning like these ones from the real Cash-in/Cash-out Online Casinos and how you implement it in JavaFX and WITH the Scenebuilder... WITHOUT to search for on StackOverflow?? :)

Now i want to say it isnt it perfect but i found a way to make it work and also looks pretty too. 
So i had done the work a push it now into Github.... Have fun with it.
